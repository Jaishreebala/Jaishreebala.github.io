                    Hey there!!! <br>
                    I am Jaishree Balamurugan - a proud Warrior! <img src="https://uwaterloo.ca/brand/sites/ca.brand/files/uploads/images/university_of_waterloo_logo.jpg" height=35px width=100px > <br>
                    I am enrolled in Computer Engineering honors. <br>
                    I love turning my thoughts into something that can be visualised - <br>
                    hence the love for making websites...<br>
                    <a href="./csn.html" ><div class="square"><br>I also enjoy programming and coding.<br><br> My coding & web developing experience can be viewed here.</div></a>
                    <a href="./pntry.html" ><div class="square">Most of my projects are self assigned - this webpage being one of them. However, I've worked on a few projects for my school too.
                            My projects and codes can be viewed here.</div></a>
                    <a href="./workexpnight.html"><div class="square"><br> I gained working knowledge about hardware during an internship.<br><br>

                            Apart from all this, <br>
                            I'm always eager to learn new things.<br>
                            People usually remark that I'm a quick learner.<br>
                            I also adore travelling and clicking photographs. <br>
                            I also love playing guitar & piano as well as listening to music. <br> 
                            I am quite passionate about writing as well as reading books. <br>
                            I mostly write stories & poetry.<br>
                             Sometimes, I also write quotes/ songs.
